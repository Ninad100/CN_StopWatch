# CN_StopWatch
**Overview**

Hello, Welcome to the Stopwatch Website page. This page contains the web application developed for utilizing the StopWatch functionality.

The code is constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The first and foremost part of this application is to design the webpage. For this, we should use HTML. In this repository, the file with the name index.html is our main HTML file where an actual webpage is constructed.

Though HTML is very useful in creating basic webpages. But to apply styles is a little challenging. Hence, we have used CSS for the styling part. After the basic webpage was structured then to apply different styles to it we used CSS. The file style.css contains different types of stylings applied to the webpage.

Finally, to make the page responsive I have used JavaScript. The javascript code is present in the file script.js.

In all the codes appropriate comments are mentioned which are helpful to understand the logic behind the code.

The code works as follows:

On the webpage, there are three buttons -> Start, stop, and reset.

On clicking Start -> The stopwatch timer will start.
On Clicking Stop -> The stopwatch timer will stop at its current position during that time.
On clicking Reset -> The stopwatch timer will stop and the counter will also get reset to zero.

The website to launch code is https://ninad100.github.io/CN_StopWatch.github.io/
